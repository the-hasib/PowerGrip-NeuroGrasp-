## 🚧 Currently Under Development
**Welcome to the dev-log of PowerGrip!**
This project is currently **active and ongoing**. We are constantly refining the algorithms, tweaking the mechanical design, and testing new features. What you see here is our journey towards building a fully functional robotic rehabilitation assistant.

## 👋 The Vision
Imagine losing the ability to hold a cup of coffee. For millions of stroke survivors, this is reality.
**PowerGrip (NeuroGrasp)** is our attempt to bridge the gap between expensive medical equipment and affordable home therapy. We are building a smart exoskeleton that "listens" to muscle signals and helps patients regain hand mobility.

## 🚀 Why This Matters
Recovery shouldn't be boring or inaccessible. We are working on:
* **🧠 Mind-Reading Control:** Using **EMG sensors** to detect intent and assist movement.
* **🪞 Mirror Therapy:** A mode where the robotic hand mimics the healthy hand (Neuroplasticity).
* **🛡️ Smart Safety:** An "Artificial Reflex" system that prevents crushing delicate objects.
* **☁️ Remote Doctor Access:** IoT integration so doctors can monitor progress from anywhere.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current State)
We are building this using:

| Component | Role in Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ESP32** | The brain (Dual-core processing & Wi-Fi) |
| **AD8232** | Muscle Sensor (EMG) |
| **MG996R** | High-Torque Servo Motor |
| **FSR 402** | Pressure Sensor (Feedback Loop) |
| **ThingSpeak** | Cloud Dashboard for Data |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
Since this is an ongoing project, here is what we plan to add next:
- [ ] Refine the PCB design for a smaller form factor.
- [ ] Add support for linear actuators for elbow support (Scalability).
- [ ] Improve the Android App for easier user control.
- [ ] machine Learning model for better EMG signal classification.
